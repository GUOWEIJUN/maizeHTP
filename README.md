# maizeHTP
Here, we developed an automated high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTP) and used to quantify 
image-based traits (i-traits) for 228 maize inbred lines across all developmental stages.
We upload all code used in the paper entited "Integrating high-throughput phenotyping, GWAS and
prediction models reveals the genetic architecture of plant height in maize".
